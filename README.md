This repository is the final task of the Pyhton Project for Data Science, whose theme is Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard. This is one of the required courses to obtain the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst).

The description of this course is: 
> In this mini-course you will be assuming the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst. In this role you will be given a scenario and data to begin your Python project. During this process you will perform specific tasks such as extracting data, web scraping, visualizing data, and creating a dashboard.

And the project overview is:
> For this project, you will assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks.
